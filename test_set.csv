"Powder metallurgy (PM) Ti–6Al–2Sn–4Zr–2Mo–0.1Si–(0, 2, 4)W (wt%) alloys were fabricated by thermomechanical consolidation of TiH2-based powder compacts and subsequent heat treatments. Samples of the as-fabricated alloys were also heated at 650 °C for 200 h. The addition of 2 or 4 wt%W to the base alloy changed its microstructure of parallel α/β lamellar colonies and grain boundary α (αGB) to an interwoven α/βt microstructure consisting of αGB and a network of interpenetrating α plates with β transformed structure (βt) domains comprising variants of fine α laths and β matrix. The partition of the β stabilizing W between β and α phases and the low diffusivity of W atoms limited the growth of α plates/laths, decreasing the thickness of α plates/laths and increasing the volume fraction of β. The increased hardening of the β phase and enhanced α/β interface strengthening associated with the 4 wt%W addition led to a significant increase in the tensile strength of the alloy from 1281 ± 10–1411 ± 12 MPa. However, the high flow stress and the very fine microstructure caused significant strain localization in the weak αGB, resulting in premature fracture of the αGB (intergranular fracture) and the low ductility (1.4%). Here, premature fracture meant the fracture occurred prior to the alloy reaching its ultimate tensile strength. The heating caused the β interlaths in the W-free alloy to partially dissolve and become β particles distributed along the original lines of β interlaths accompanied by the precipitation of α2-Ti3Al in the α plates. The addition of W inhibited the dissolution of β interlaths and caused the precipitation of a higher volume fraction of α2 precipitates during heating. The microstructural changes caused by heating resulted in a slight decrease in strength and a significant decrease in ductility for the W-free alloy, but a significant increase of the yield strength of the 2 W and 4 W alloys with some sacrifice of the tensile ductility. The microstructural reasons for the effects on mechanical properties were analyzed with the assistance of detailed characterization of the dislocations in the deformed specimens."
"In this work, we fabricated a high-performance Ti-6Al-4V alloy from TiH2 and 60Al40V powder mixtures by powder metallurgy (PM) pressureless sintering and hot extrusion. The correlation among sintering temperature, hot extrusion microstructure, and mechanical properties was systematically investigated. The dehydrogenation of the mixed powder during sintering promotes the closure of pores and obtains a fine, fully dense microstructure. The billets sintered at 1200 °C possess a denser lamellar microstructure consisting of small (α + β) colonies, which provide more nucleation points during the later deformation. We made a detailed investigation into the deformation behavior and dislocation motion of the special lamellar structure in the fabricated Ti-6Al-4V via EBSD and TEM. The uniform α/β lamellar interface generated by continuous dynamic recrystallization is a good location for geometrically necessary dislocation generation and storage. The synergistic improvement of strength and ductility after extrusion is attributed to the homogeneous and fine recrystallized microstructure and the smooth appearance of deformation twins. The ultimate tensile strength of extruded rod is up to 1213 MPa and the elongation increases to 14 %. This work proposes a simplified method to achieve low-cost PM Ti alloys with excellent performance."
"The T3 sample reaches the best strength-ductile matching of the sintered billets. It shows a UTS of 1000 MPa and EL of 9.1 %, far exceeding the T0 sample sintered at the same temperature. Up to the T4 sample, the strength and ductility start to decrease due to the grain coarsening and excessive oxygen content."
"After hot extrusion, the UTS and EL of T3-HE sample increase to 1213 MPa and 14 %, respectively. Compared with the T3 sample, these values correspond to an increase of 21.3 % and 53.8 %, respectively. Furthermore, the T3-HE sample also shows an apparent slow necking stage (a), reflecting its good ductility."
"The economic Ti-6Al-4V alloys with TiH2 + 60Al40V as raw material are prepared by blended elemental powder metallurgy. After the sintering with dehydrogenation, the lamellar structure is significantly refined, and the sintered density is improved. The UTS and EL of Ti-6Al-4V alloy sintered at 1200 °C are 1000 MPa and 9.1 %, respectively."
"After hot extrusion, the UTS and EL of Ti-6Al-4V alloy are increased to 1213 MPa and 14 %, respectively. The refined lamellae become a good place for dislocation to generate and accumulate. The multi-slip dislocation and deformation twins provide a better matching of strength and ductility for Ti alloys."
"High contents of Sc and Zr elements were introduced into the Al−Mg alloy, which contributed to the stabilization of UFG boundaries in the form of sub-micro primary Al3(Sc, Zr) particles and resulted in the formation of supersaturated Sc and Zr solid solutions in CG. The afterward aging treatment or well-controlled hot isostatic pressing (HIP) induced uniform precipitation of the high-density nano-scale coherent Al3(Sc, Zr) phase in CG. The HIP also promoted a significant decrease in porosity of the alloy and resulted in a combination of high ultimate tensile strength of 560 MPa and elongation of 12 %."
"The yield strength, ultimate tensile strength, and total elongation of the as-built samples are determined to be 345 MPa, 409 MPa, and 16% respectively. The as-built sample has a yield ratio of 0.84. A lower yield ratio means a high work-hardening rate in as-built alloy. The mechanical properties of the as-built samples are comparable to those of Al−Mg−Sc−Zr alloys with heat treatment and greatly improved compared with those of as-cast alloys."
"The strength of heat-treated samples was significantly improved by the introduction of nano-scale Al3(Sc, Zr) phase. The strength of the alloy reaches its peak value after aging treatment at 300 °C for four hours, the yield strength reaches 469 MPa, and the tensile strength is 502 MPa. HIP-ed alloys obtained slightly higher tension strength (560 MPa) than aging treatment at 300 °C, and the elongation (12 %) of HIP-ed alloys was significantly improved due to the reduction of macroscopic defects. The heat-treated samples show the advantages of mechanical properties compared to the "
